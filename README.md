# Event Management Web Service
 The web service that has been designed is a login, register, creating events and booking events functionality. An existing user can login by entering their details or a new user can register. Once a user is authorised, the user is assigned a token and when making request, the user is responsible to send that token with them to confirm that they have been authenticated. Once the user is authenticated, the user will be allowed to view, book, cancel bookings and create events. If a user is not authenticated, they are only allowed to view events. This web service only focuses on login authentication, booking events and creating events and in the future, functionality can be extended on. The user is on the login/register page, if the user is not an existing customer, they can register by entering their username and password. If the username already exists, the user is notified, and the account will not be created. The user will have to enter a new username. Once the account is created, the user will be able to login, given that the user enters the correct username and password. The password is encrypted and stored in a database. Additionally, our web service provides a room reservation service that consumes another web service that offers this functionality. According to their contract, an object is parsed to their web service and their web service deals with the reservation.
